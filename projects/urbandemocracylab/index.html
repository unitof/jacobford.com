		<p>A research laboratory founded by NYU Gallatin, the Urban Democracy Lab &ldquo;promotes critical, creative, just, and sustainable forms of urbanism, through scholarship, curricular activities, public engagement, and programming.&rdquo; Basically we plan events that make people think, and I tried to make our posters do the same. Most were displayed in the Broadway-facing windows at Gallatin&rsquo;s One Washington Place lobby. Some included companion MailChimp templates for email campaigns.</p>

		<p>Copyediting is a vital part of design, and often this meant slicing paragraphs of event description into a phrase or two, then trusting the poster&lsquo;s graphic tension and visual puns to communicate the rest. But our audience is more than its attention span, and try to design posters that function in three phases:
		<ol>
			<li>The passerby: color scheme and iconography work to present something curious, something worth looking at. I do not spend minutes soaking in every advertisement in my periphery; I can&rsquo;t expect my viewers to do the same</li>
			<li>The skimmer: my poster may have earned someone&rsquo;s attention, but attention isn&rsquo;t dedication. Short phrases set in large type and composition should make the event&rsquo;s basic subject clear within five seconds, so the viewer knows if it&rsquo;s worth reading on.</li>
			<li>The reader: <i>now</i> we may expect the viewer to read blocks of text, but only very special viewers make it this far. They deserve something succint and well-composed. Details ready to be added to a calendar.</li>
		</ol>
