		<p>I developed what become known as the Tic-Tac-Toe identity (though I strongly preferred The Grid), to be used across all promotional material. It showed up on coffee cup sleeves, napkin dispensers in the university cafeterias, hats, shirts, and on all flyers for the individual events which Violet 100 comprised.</p>
		<p>Then we decided to make a sticker the size of a building.</p>

		<!-- <p>On a cold windy day I went and measured all the windows and designed a template on which we could mockup our designs. Two schedules pointed in from either side to a Tic Tac Toe box, and the whole thing was made amazing with a split and rotated box across all four center doors.</p> -->
